\* invariant for all nodes, the ver and val should match. if there is consistency however, val > ver can happen. 
\* Because the client read an old ver, and cntr is incrementing as usual and ver becomes lower than cntr=val.

Consistent == \A p \in Nodes: \A m \in db[p]: m.ver=m.val
\*\* It is possible to write alternative Consistent properties,
\*\* this one is shortcut leveraging the way the client stores items to the storage system.

For the "Consistent" property to hold as invariant, the following should hold:
FAILNUM < ReadQ /\ FAILNUM < WriteQ 

If ~(FAILNUM < WriteQ) then all the WriteQ nodes (where the new version has been
written) can fail, and the ReadQ will read the old version, and the next write will violate "Consistent".

If ~(FAILNUM < ReadQ) then all the ReadQ nodes can fail, new version will be written to WriteQ, a separate set of nodes then the previous ReadQ. Then when the failed nodes are recovered again, when version is read from ReadQ, the new version will not be seen (because WriteQ does not intersect with ReadQ), and the next write will violate "Consistent".
